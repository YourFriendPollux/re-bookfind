## Project overview

The **BookFind** project is designed to simplify the management of book loans within a CDI. The application allows users to:
- Search for available books
- Borrow books
- View their current loans
- Access protected features if they are graded

This application offers an efficient solution for the CDI staff and their users.

## Features

- **Home page**: Presentation of the application and a book search form.
- **Book search**: Interface allowing users to find books by their title.
- **Loan management**: View borrowed books and loan history.
- **Login and user profile**: Authentication with hashed passwords, access to restricted features, as well as a space to manage your own profile or edit another user's profile if you are graded. The editable parts vary depending on the permission level.

## Project structure

- `index.php`: Main page of the application, introducing the book search service.
- `login.php`: Login page to authenticate users.
- `books.php`: Book search page with a form to enter search criteria.
- `profile.php`: Interface allowing users to view and edit their personal information.
- `loans.php`: Page where the user can see the books they have borrowed.
- `privacy.php`: Page displaying the privacy policy and terms of use.
- `rules.php`: Page displaying the rules.

### Directories

- `actions/`: Contains the PHP and JavaScript scripts for actions, such as the database connection, registering a book and the general operation of the site.
- `includes/`: Components included in the various pages, such as `header.php`, `navbar.php` and `footer.php`, for consistent display. This folder centralizes pieces of code that do not need to be repeated and where changes impact every page.
- `assets/`: Resources such as CSS files, images and icons.
- `temp/`: Contains temporary files.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository or download the ZIP**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chromared/bookfind.git
    ```
2. **Local server setup**:
    - Use XAMPP, WAMP, or another server with PHP and MySQL.
3. **Move the project**:
    - Place the extracted folder in the root directory of your web server (usually `htdocs` on web servers and XAMPP, or `www` for WAMP and uWAMP).

## Configure BookFind

1. In your browser, go to the `configuration.php` file.
2. Follow the actions **in order** to configure the database and the classes of your institution...
3. When you are done, click the button that appears to delete the `configuration.php` file. This action is required for security reasons. The file must not remain accessible after configuration.
